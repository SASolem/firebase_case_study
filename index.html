            <h2>Brief History</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Firebase originated with Envolve, a startup founded in the company in 2011 by Andrew Lee and James Tamplin.</li>
                <li>The company offered an API for developers to facilitate the integration of online chats into websites. Envolve's founders noticed that their chat service was used to forward non-chat messages.</li>
                <li>Developers relied on the platform to synchronize application data in real-time. Lee and Tamplin decided to separate the differentiate real-time architecture from the chat system, which led to the creation of Firebase in 2011. The Firebase Backend-as-a-Service platform was unveiled to the public and launched in April 2012.</li>
                <li>The first Firebase product launched to hit the market was the Realtime Database. This is an API for synchronizing application data between Android synchronization, Web, and iOS devices. Application developers can rely on the platform to create collaborative real-time applications.</li>
            </ul>
